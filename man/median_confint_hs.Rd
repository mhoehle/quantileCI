\title{Two-sided confidence interval method for the median by the method of
Hettmansperger & Sheather (1991)}
\usage{
median_confint_hs(
  x,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  x_is_sorted = FALSE,
  interpolate = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of observations}

\item{conf.level}{A conf.level * 100\% confidence interval is
computed}

\item{x_is_sorted}{Boolean (Default: FALSE) to safe sorting x, if
it is already sorted. This is merely for speed reasons in
situations where it is more efficient to only sort x once.}

\item{interpolate}{Boolean (Default: TRUE) stating whether to
interpolate the order statistics. If no interpolation is selected
then this is just the standard exact procedure based on the order
statistics. Note: This procedure is conservative (i.e. coverage
is usualler larger than the nominal conf.level and hence the
interval is actually in general too large).}
}
\value{
A vector of length two containing the lower and upper limit
  of the confidence interval
}
\description{
Two-sided confidence interval method for the median by the method of
Hettmansperger & Sheather (1991)
}
\details{
The interpolation procedure suggested by Hettmansperger
  and Sheather (1986) for the median is applied to the order
  statistic.
